# Golden-file tests for the slide-sub-heading filter.
#
# A case is a directory under tests/cases/ holding `input.qmd`. Rendering it
# produces one capture — exit code, stdout, stderr — which is compared against
# `expected.txt`. A case may also hold a `format` file naming the target format
# the filter should believe it is running for; without one it is revealjs.
#
# stdout is the pandoc native AST: it shows which headers were flattened onto
# the slide level, the "Parent - Child" titles they were given, and that
# identifiers and classes survived the rewrite.
#
# The filter asks `quarto.doc.is_format` for the target format, which plain
# pandoc does not provide, so cases run through quarto-stub.lua, which supplies
# that one function and then loads the filter — no quarto install needed.
#
#   tests/run.sh                  all cases
#   tests/run.sh latex reset-     only cases whose name contains a pattern
#   tests/run.sh --update         rewrite expected.txt from the actual capture
